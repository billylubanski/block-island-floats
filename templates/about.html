    <h2>About the Project</h2>
    <p class="about-text">
        The Block Island Glass Float Tracker is a community-driven tool designed to help float hunters analyze
        historical data and improve their chances of finding a glass float.
    </p>

    <h3 class="about-section-title">What are Glass Floats?</h3>
    <p class="about-text">
        Every year, glass artist Eben Horton hides hundreds of numbered glass floats (orbs) along the trails and beaches
        of Block Island. They are dated and numbered. If you find one, it's yours to keep!
    </p>

    <h3 class="about-section-title">How This Works</h3>
    <p class="about-text">
        This application scrapes the official registry of found floats to build a database of discovery locations and
        dates. We use this data to:
    </p>
    <ul class="about-list">
        <li>Identify "hot spots" where floats are frequently found.</li>
        <li>Analyze seasonal trends to determine the best months to hunt.</li>
        <li>Visualize the distribution of finds across the island.</li>
    </ul>

            All data is sourced from public reports. Locations are approximate based on finder descriptions. This tool
            is for recreational use and does not guarantee finding a float. Please respect the island, stay on trails,
            and follow all local regulations.
